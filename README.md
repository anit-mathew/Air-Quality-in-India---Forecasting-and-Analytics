# Project Title: Air Quality in India - Forecasting and Analytics

# Authors: Anit Mathew and Ritwik Katiyar

# Overview:
This GitHub repository contains a comprehensive analysis of air pollution in India, focusing on forecasting and analytics. The project aims to predict the air pollution situation in the coming year based on historical data. The analysis delves into year-wise trends, monthly variations, and utilizes machine learning models for forecasting.

# Key Features:

Data Cleaning: The dataset is cleaned to ensure accuracy in analysis.
Data Analysis and Visualizations: Bar plots, heat maps, and line plots provide insights into air pollution trends over the years, months, and hours.
Forecasting Models: Linear Regression, ARIMA, and Auto ARIMA models are implemented to predict air pollution levels.
Model Comparison: Different models are compared based on Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate their performance.
Insights: Key findings and patterns in air pollution are discussed, providing valuable insights for environmental analysis.

# Results and Conclusions:

Winters are identified as the most polluted time, with a declining trend in pollution levels over the years.
Auto ARIMA and ETS models suggest a minor decrease in air pollution levels for the coming year.

# Future Scope:
The project outlines potential areas for further research, such as expanding the dataset and exploring additional factors influencing air quality.

# References:
The project incorporates various statistical and machine-learning techniques, with references provided for further exploration.
