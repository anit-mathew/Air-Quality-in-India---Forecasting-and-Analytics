# Introduction
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the "Air Quality in India - Forecasting and Analytics" project, authored by Anit Mathew and Ritwik Katiyar. This project focuses on the analysis of air pollution in India, utilizing data spanning from 2017 to 2022. The primary objectives include understanding the yearly air pollution trends, identifying monthly variations, and forecasting air pollution levels for the year 2023.

# Key Highlights:
Data Source: The project relies on the "Air Quality Data in India" dataset, originally uploaded by 'fedesoriano' on Kaggle.

Analysis Techniques: The project employs various analytical techniques, including time series analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning (ARIMA and Auto ARIMA models).

Insights: The findings highlight the seasonality of air pollution, with winters being the most polluted period. Notable insights include the decline in pollution levels over the years, the impact of seasons, and predictions indicating a stable pollution scenario for the coming year.
